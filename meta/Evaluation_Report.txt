What I Learned
===============

Making websites with HTML and CSS is time consuming. Sometimes a little frustrating. You have to tweak the settings a lot for CSS to cooperate

========================
What I Am Most Proud Of
========================
Well I am proud that this OMGenius idea me and my brother came up with a long time ago has stuck around so long I could make a website for it! My brother's gonna see it complete for the first time today.

====================================
What I Would Improve with More Time
====================================
I would probably add a lot more things.
Make the community page actually feel like it has a community / forum. Fix the "More" page's form formatting since it's a bit weird.
I would also a night mode, and if you look in the mockups that was actually one of the things I was gonna add from the beginning. 

================================
Explanation of Design Decisions
================================
Color: I literally just went to colormind.io, clicked website colors, generated it a few times and picked the one I had. I liked the orange as the main color.

Fonts: Well OMGenius is all about sleek in theory, so all the fonts should be as modern and slick as possible. I even tried to find a good monospaced font for the terminal section.

Layouts: I took some inspiration from several websites like godotengine.org and celestegame.com, and one other but i forgot the name... anyway, with the inspiration it was pretty easy to freestyle the rest of the website.

If im honest idk what the whole "flat design, content first, emphasis on typography" is... LOL
